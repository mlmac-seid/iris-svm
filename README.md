# iris-svm
This project demonstrates how Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers behave with different values of the regularization parameter C, using a subset of the scikit-learn Iris dataset. It provides clear 2D decision boundary plots and a 3D visualization of the data distribution. Work completed for CS 3262 at Vanderbilt University.
